    "    1. Does user's demographic impact the genres of anime they are open to watch?\n",
    "        - This helps in identifying the genres a user prefers based on their demographic. With this we can suggest better animes from these genres that are more likely to suit the user's interests.\n",
    "    2. Is there a relationship between number of anime watched and the variety of genres a user likes?\n",
    "        - This is important as this helps to understand if people who watch more animes are open to vast variety of anime genres. If so, we can recommend varied animes to maintain user interest\n",
    "2. Rutuja:\n",
    "    1. Do different age groups prefer anime with varying durations?\n",
    "        - This will help us understand the relation between age and time spent by particular user, with this information we can introduce more number of animes for largest age group thus increasing our platform engagement.\n",
    "    2. Does the number of episodes affect the score of anime?\n",
    "        - This will help us to understand the optimum number of episodes so that we can use this information in future and produce animes which will be liked by majority of users.\n",

    "3. Seokwoo Park:\n",
    "    1. Is it possible to find out the differences between time to watch anime and other columns?\n",
    "        - I can make sure that developed countries are likely to have more time to watch anime due to their economic prosperity and advanced cultural development.\n",
    "    2. When grouping columns based on age, What kind of correlation or trend can we derive from this?\n",
    "        - With the increasing variety of anime in recent years, viewing time and the number of viewers are likely to grow as age increases."
